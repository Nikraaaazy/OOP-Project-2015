More insulting are flabby, which suggests loose flesh, and podgy, used especially of fingers and hands. 贬义更强的词是flabby（指肌肉松弛）和podgy（尤指手指和手）. To be polite we can use plump, suggesting slight or attractive fatness, or stout, indicating overall heaviness of the body. 较礼貌些可用plump（指稍胖或丰满）或stout（指身体胖得匀称）. Tubby is often used in a friendly way of people who are also short, and chubby indicates pleasant roundness in babies and cheeks. *tubby常用以指矮胖的人, 含亲切感, 而chubby则用於婴儿和脸颊, 意为圆胖而可爱. The most neutral term is overweight, while doctors use obese to describe people who are so overweight that they are unhealthy. 最无褒贬含义的词是overweight, 医生则用obese指胖得呈病态的人.
